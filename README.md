# Project E-commerce 🖥️ 🛒

# Description 📜 

The aim of the project was to create a backend for an imaginary online shop using **Node Js** and **Express** together with **MySQL** and **Sequelize**. A variety of REST APIs provide access to the data.

# Objectives 🎯

The obligatory requirements for completing the exercice consist of:

- [x] At least four tables with one-to-many and many-to-many associations (Users, Products, Categories, Orders) and a diagram to visualise the relations.
- [x] User registration and password encryption with **Bcrypt**
- [x] Login with **JSON Web tokens** and the use of middleware
- [x] A variety of CRUD endpoints
- [x] Data validation
- [x] Seeders to create data

Optional:

- [x]  Admin and Superadmin roles
- [x] Email confirmation on registration using **Nodemailer**  
- [x]  An extra table of Reviews associated to Products and Users  
- [ ]  **Multer** to facilitate the uploading of images

Extras that I added:

- [x]  Extra endpoints to visualise data in different ways to consolidate the use of *inlude*, *through*, column aliases 
- [x]  An endpoint for an admin to approve of reviews before their publication
- [x] Front. A single page application as the user interface.


## Data modelling 🔄

I created a visual diagram of the database tables using MySQL Workbench: 

![Diagram](./readme_img/Diagram_ecommerce.png)

The database consists of 5 main tables: Users, Orders, Products, Categories and Reviews.

Table tokens is used for control purposes and is where session tokens are saved.  

Two junction tables define many-to-many relationships between categories and products, and products and orders. The latter has an extra column to record the quantity of each product in an order.

## Project architecture 🛠️

The organisation of folders and files becomes logical after a little practice, but for a first-timer it can look complex. Below is a breakdown of the program's file structure:


📁CONFIG 
- Defines my connection to the database in the development environment as well as password for authenticating tokens and using Nodemailer. The file is not uploaded to github; instead, an example template is uploaded.
Here we also have the file for Nodemailer.

📁CONTROLLERS 
- Code for different CRUD endpoints to interact with the database. Each table has its own file.

📁MIDDLEWARE 
- Authentication methods to check if a user is logged in (= has been issued a session token) or is an administrator. These checks are necessary to define actions that the user can perform with the database.

- Error handling: With Express, we can add a third parameter (req, res, **next**) to asynchronous functions and   "outsource" the handling of common errors to this middleware, which results in more efficient programming.

📁MIGRATIONS 
- Migrations are instructions for and a track record of changes in the database. Table columns and their properties may be defined here before performing the migration, i.e. creating or modifying a table.

📁MODELS 
- As the name says, models store the table structure,associations and constraints. As the endpoint methods make reference to these models, the table associations (one-to-many, many-to-many...), properties (datatype, required data field...) and validations must be correctly recorded here. 

📁NODE_MODULES 
- Nodemodules is an automatically created folder by Node JS and is where packages are stored. The contents are not uploaded to github.

📁ROUTES 
- Routes define the crud method and url to perform actions with the database. Here we also define which actions may need additional authentication.

📁SEEDERS 
- Seeders are used to create bulk data for the database for testing purposes.

📄index.js 
- This is the file that handles the initialisation of the program and the local server.

📄package-lock.json & package.json 
- The dependencies I am using are listed here.

📄.gitignore 
- Gitignore controls files that contain information that should not be committed or uploaded.


Furthermore, I created an infograph of the basic steps for the creation and manipulation of tables to better grasp the process before starting:

## Points of interest and Observations ❕


## 🔎 Using user-supplied info to find items
Parameters - added to URL:  **findByPk** or  **where**-clause: 

```js
const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id);
```
```js
const foundUser = await User.findOne({
                where: {
                    id: req.params.id
                }
                });
```
Using req.body - information typically from a form:

```js
const user = await User.findOne({
                where: { email: req.body.email }
            });
```


## ⛓️ Including associated tables

Include associated table:

```js
 const product = await Product.findAll({
                include: {
                    model: Review
                }
            });
```

Include an associated table, and another table associated with it:

```js
const categories = await Category.findAll({
                include: [{ model: Product, include: [{ model: Review }] }]
            });
```


Include an associated table through a junction table.
```js
     const orders = await Order.findAll({
                include: [{ model: Product, through: { model: Order_Product, }}]
            })
```


Including **Attributes** (array) allows us to specify which information to include and which to exclude: 
```js
const reviews = await Review.findAll({
                include: [{ 
                    model: Product, 
                    attributes: ["id", "name"]
                }, {
                    model: User,
                    attributes: ["id", "name", "surname", "email"]
                 }] 
            })
```

Specify the **attributes** array but leave it empty - we can exclude the data. In this case, junction table is necessary to access the category related to the product, but we don't want to see any data from the through-table:

```js
const foundProduct = await Product.findByPk(req.params.id, {
                include:  { 
                    model: Category, 
                    attributes:["name"], 
                    through: { attributes: [] } //Excludes data from the junction table
                 }
            }) 
```

By adding another item in the attributes array, we can specify an **alias** for the data:

```js
attributes: [["id", "Order ID"]], //second value is alias
```


## 🔣 Using Sequelize operators:
Import **Op** and add to model object:
```js
const { Op } = Sequelize; 
const { Category, Product, Category_Product, Review, Sequelize } = require("../models/index.js");
```

```js
...
    const category = await Category.findAll({
        where: {
            name: { [Op.like]: `%${req.params.name}%` }
        }
    })
```

```js
    const products = await Product.findAll({
        where: {
            price: { [Op.between]: [(+req.params.price - 50), (+req.params.price + 50)] } //RANGE +- hundred  
                }
            });
```

## ↕️ Ordering results
```js
 const products = await Product.findAll({
                order: [   
                    ["price", "DESC"], //Array inside array
                ], 
            })
```

## ⛓️ Updating junction/associated tables:

Sequelize provides an easy way to modify associations while modifying the main table.
With **add-** and **set-** methods, it is possible to pass an **array** to pass more than one value

```js
const product = await Product.create(req.body);
product.addCategories(req.body.CategoryId); //addCategories creates entry to junction table
```

Postman:

![Postman](./readme_img/associations_add.png)

```js
await foundProduct.update(req.body);
foundProduct.setCategories(req.body.CategoryId); //setCategories updates junction table
```


In theory, Sequelize provides a way to delete associations by adding the following line to the Model:

```js
Product.hasMany(models.Review, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
```
However, in practice, **this does not appear to work**. It seems other programmers have faced similar issues. Therefore, the deletion of associations must be defined in the controller.

```js
await Product.destroy({where: {id: req.params.id}})           
await Review.destroy({where: {ProductId: req.params.id}});  //Delete from junction table
```

Currently, deletions of associated tables still need to be reviewed in the project.
